One can navigate through the different sections using the menu above:\nThe project contains various datasets related to segregation, restrictive confinement, and deaths in custody. For each dataset, a dedicated R analysis script has been prepared to facilitate associated statistical analysis in the Positron/VS Code IDEs."

    "text": "Getting Started with the Project\nThe Ministry of the Solicitor General is committed to providing greater transparency by releasing data on all custodial-related deaths that occurred within the calendar year reporting period. The datasets in this category include info on gender, race, age, religion or spiritual affiliation, and alerts for mental health concerns and suicide risk. To begin the investigation(s):\n\nOpen the R Project: Navigate to the OTIS_Report_Stats1a directory and open the OTIS_Report_Stats1a.Rproj file in Positron or RStudio. This will set the working directory correctly.\nExplore Data: The data/ subdirectory contains all the raw CSV files.\nRun Analysis Scripts: The scripts/ subdirectory contains individual analysis_bXX.R, analysis_cXX.R, and analysis_dXX.R files. Each script loads a specific dataset and includes initial exploratory commands.\n\nThe encouragement is toward exploring the data, standardizing the investigatory scripts, and contribute to the understanding of important information through empirical observations."

As a result, the ministry is reporting on any case within the fiscal year reporting period where an individual was held in a unit regularly scheduled to be locked down for 17 hours or more per day. This timeframe is considered more restrictive than that of the general population based on an assessment of provincewide lockdown times. Regularly scheduled lockdowns are daily routine times where movement out of a cell is restricted, such as during meal times and overnight."
